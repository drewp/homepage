    <h1>What Are Post Files</h1>

    <p>On my home network, I can easily put a file in a directory that
    anyone can read on the web. I use this to post images and other
    files similar to how I use identica or my blog to post text.</p>

    <p>A little web server using Twisted provides the
    recently-edited listing for my home page.</p>
