    <h3>2002 Theater playbill for <i>Guys and Dolls</i>:</h3>

    Drew has worked on PLOT shows since 1990, and he recently
    lit <i>City of Angels</i> at Masquers. For the last few years, he
    has been building a computerized lighting system with fellow
    lighting designer and programmer David McClosky. Drew tests all
    his inventions at his home in Berkeley, much to the dismay of his
    housemates. When he's not in the theater, Drew designs commerce
    websites and creates visual effects for films.


    <h3>2001 Theater playbill for <i>Kiss Me Kate</i>:</h3>

    This year, for the first time, Drew will have worked on PLOT shows for
    more than half his life. Drew graduated from U.C. Berkeley's School of
    Engineering last year after studying computer graphics and computer
    vision. He returned to Berkeley as a teaching assistant last semester
    and now is looking for a job creating visual effects for movies.  At
    home he regularly violates his lease conditions by building giant
    furniture and lighting systems. Even his W.C. has a sound system and
    computer-controlled lighting.


    <h3>2002 Theater playbill for <i>City of Angels</i>:</h3>

    Drew has lit Bay Area shows for the last 12 years. By day, he programs
    web sites and ticketing systems for a ferry company; by night, he
    designs visual effects for films. At home he regularly violates his
    lease conditions by building giant furniture and lighting
    systems. Drew is attempting to use his electrical engineering and
    computer science degree to build an advanced computerized lighting
    system.


    <h3><a href="http://www.creativecow.net/leaders/perttula_drew/perttula_drew.html">Creative Cow</a> profile</h3>

    Drew is an open source nut who aims to work on visual effects
    production. He builds ridiculous hardware and writes all sorts of
    software. Some of his favorite answers to computer questions are "zsh
    can already do that" and "I'd recommend python".

    Drew took two paying video projects in the last year, yet he owns no
    video editing software and does not intend to buy any. This is why
    it's very important that he develop his own editing system, and
    fast. You'll be able to use it, too, real soon now.

    Drew Perttula is a leader in the Linux forum at Creativecow.net.


    <h3><a href="http://linuxmovies.bigasterisk.com/DrewP">Linuxmovies resource guide introduction</a></h3>

    I'm Drew Perttula, from Berkeley, CA. I started the wiki, which is why
    some pages are modified by my zope user drewp instead of my wiki name
    DrewP.

    I have another job doing programming, web site construction, and
    system administration. I want to be working on films. I was a tester
    for Silicon Grail's Rayz compositor before it got eaten. I'm a regular
    gimp user, and I write python scripts to auto-generate graphics with
    the gimp.

    I'm working on a theater lighting controller and a DV editing suite.

    I hang out on irc.openprojects.net in #python, #livid, #pygame, #zope,
    #matterial, and #slackware.


    <h3>Brief graphics and programming background</h3>

    At UC Berkeley, I focused on computer graphics and computer vision. I
    also took a few hardware and computer architechture courses (and
    returned to TA for two of them). I took some elective dynamics and
    fluid mechanics courses because I'm interested in physical
    simulation. Nowadays, I work on open source projects such as a <a
                                                                      href="http://light9.bigasterisk.com">theater lighting control system</a>
    and a <a href="http://cuisine.bigasterisk.com/">digital video
      editor</a>. Some other past projects are on my <a href="http://bigasterisk.com">homepage</a>.
    <p>
      I much prefer the open source world, although I have experience with Media
      100, Premiere, and Final Cut Pro systems; and Rayz and Maya.

      <h3>A Cuisine presentation intro</h3>


      I've always lived in the Bay Area, and I studied computer graphics and
      computer vision at U.C. Berkeley. I took some elective dynamics, fluid
      mechanics, and robotics courses because I'm interested in physical
      simulation. I've been a videographer since 1992 and interested in
      computer graphics for all my moviegoing life. I've worked on theater
      lighting for almost that long, which I love because of the teamwork
      between artists and technicians and because quality, efficiency, and
      creativity are all rewarded.
    <p>
      Cuisine is one of my recent projects. I took two paying video projects in
      the last year, yet I owned no video editing software and didn't intend
      to buy any. Like a good open-source enthusiast, I started developing
      my own (after researching the existing systems). My first priority
      was to complete the first video project by November 2002, but my other
      big priority was to build something that would continue to work for me
      and would help others. Cuisine is a set of libraries and small tools
      for processing, annotating, and editing video. I'll be talking about
      the design decisions I made, the tools I chose, and what I'm now able
      to accomplish.

    <h3>Computer experience</h3>

    Basic since 1984, C since 1993, Perl and Tcl since 1996, Python since 1999.
    <p>
      DOS (and some CP/M) since 1984. Owned an Amiga since 1989. Run Linux
      machines since about 1995; continuously since 1996 (web site since
      around <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970412181448/http://fhb121.reshall.berkeley.edu/">then</a>, too). </p>

      <h3 id="courses">Academic history</h3>

      I attended the <a href="http://www.college-prep.org/">College
        Preparatory School</a> in Oakland, California from 1992-1996.  Then I
      attended <a name="berkeley"/>U.C. Berkeley, described below.
    <p>
      Most course names are fictional based on what I remember
      learning.</p>
    <p>
      Schedules are approximate, as I may have deviated from my official
      schedules in ways that I have now forgotten. Some subjects are
      abbreviated: computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical
      engineering.  You could try to look up course descriptions at
      <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/catalog/">on Berkeley's site</a>.</p>

    <h3>Even more background</h3>

    I like to build my own furniture. Here's a <a href="http://bigasterisk.com/post/shelf.jpg">plan for a shelf</a> I now
    use. I built my own desk which can be seen in the photos at the bottom of <a href="http://www.linuxmovies.org/meeting/2002/11.07.highlights.html">this recent page</a>. 
    <a href="http://bigasterisk.com/projects/apartment/overlay">Here's</a> a
    composite image showing the desk shortly after I built it. The left
    half is a POV-Ray rendering of the plans for the desk; the right half
    of the image is a photo of the desk (with a wide-angle lens). The
    chair is in the middle of the dissolve from rendered to real, so it
    only appears halfway.
