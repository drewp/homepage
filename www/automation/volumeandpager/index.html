Half the desk. See the three red lights in the shelf? The bottom one
is the pager. The upper monitor is for <a href=/machine>my other
workstation</a>. It shows logs and other things I always want
visible. The monitor to the right displays video.

This is the box that the bottom red LED is on. It's a hand-made panel with 8 buttons
which are encoded to 4 wires with a poor man's multiplexer circuit (a
bunch of diodes). Pressing a button will change the signals on the
wires. That signal is read many times a second by the K8000 board (see
below). The reader software notices a request on those inputs and
opens a socket to my main workstation. There, an <a href=RealPager>fvwm2 plugin</a> 
answers and listens for the desktop number to switch to. I also have
Ctrl-Shift-arrow mapped to change desktops, so I use that a lot since
it's closer (and available on the machine at work too).

This is a farther and higher view than the previous picture's. You can
see the whole <a href=http://www.velleman.be/kits/k8000.htm>K8000
board</a> here, along with two little experimenter boards that contain
additional control circuits. Part of the board is obscured by waxed
paper on plexiglass.  There's a hole in the shelf for a cable to go
through, and I'm able to get a pinhole camera projection of the front
yard through the hole. There's also a telephone punch block visible in 
all these pictures. When I had even more lighting and sound control wired
up (in previous residences), I used that to organize the cables running
everywhere.
<p>
There's one more active circuit, which you can hardly see. At the far
right, against the monitor, there's a voltage divider that scales down
the level on my telephone pair. That's fed to one of the optoisolators
on the K8000 (in fact, it's why there's a red light on in the middle
of the K8000 board). When I pick up the phone, that LED turns off and
the polling computer notices that the phone is off-hook. Via some tiny
<a href=volume.py>client</a> / <a href=volumeserver.py>server</a>
python programs, the polling computer is able to fade down the music
on the music-playing computer when I pick up my phone. Phone rings are
also trackable.
