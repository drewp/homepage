<h2>USB webcams</h2>



<h2>Multiplexed video cams</h2>

<p>I have one bt848 video capture card in a computer, but I wanted to connect a few video cameras at once. I used a <a href="http://octopart.com/mc14052bcp-on+semiconductor-49906">MC14052BCP analog multiplexer chip</a> and two pins on a parallel port to let my camera software flip the video input before grabbing a frame. </p>

<h2>Snapshot tool</h2>

<p>When I'm looking at live frames from a camera, I can click a button to save a snapshot. Button clicks result in an ajax HTTP call from the browser that is forwarded to a snapshot service which fetches a new frame and write it to disk.</p>

<p><a href="//bigasterisk.com/darcs/?r=httpsnapshot;a=tree">Code is here.</a> This is a web server that fetches preset resources from other web servers and saves them into files according to templates. On my camera viewing pages, I simply put POST forms that request that a picture is saved. The httpsnapshot service grabs a jpeg frame, saves it into my photo area, and my photo site notices the new file automatically.</p>
