	  <p>I'm using <a href="http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd">speech
	  dispatcher</a> to make the house talk. I think it's using
	  the festival backend, but I'm not sure. 
	  My <a href="//bigasterisk.com/darcs/?r=entrancemusic;a=headblob;f=/websound.py">code is here</a>.  
	  It listens for HTTP POSTs and plays speech and
	  music. Right now it only announces when wireless devices
	  enter and leave the network, but there's more we'd like it
	  to say. If you haven't been on the network for a while, and
	  we have a song on file for your device, you'll get welcome
	  music as well as a spoken introduction.</p>

	  <p>I wish I didn't have to write websound.py. There should
	  be better sound servers out there that can do good timing
	  and mixing for this kind of application. Maybe <a href="http://puredata.info/">pd</a> would be good. Sometimes
	  the speech silently fails to work. I don't know what's going
	  on yet. </p>
