	  <p>I connected a USB bluetooth adapter to a linux server. Reading it from python is pretty easy. I poll continuously for new devices, which I think means a period of about 6 seconds. Bluetooth scanning is really slow.</p>

	  <p><a href="//bigasterisk.com/darcs/?r=room;a=headblob;f=/io.bluetooth">The code</a> has lots of leftover name lookup stuff, but mostly it's just writing the discoveries to mongodb and pinging the speech/music service to announce arrivals and departures.</p>
	  
	  <p>The bluetooth sensor does not detect my phone from one room away, but it does find a MacBook at about that distance.</p>
