	  <p> There are light dimmers all around my room that dim lights 
	  based on 0-12 volt control signals from a control board attached
	  to my computer.</p>
	  <p>To keep everything cheap, I build the boards by hand.</p>
	  <p>Seth Sanders and Yi Zhang at the electrical engineering
	  department at U.C. Berkeley helped me
	  with the inductors. I bought some cores, and 
	  Yi showed me how to build these.</p>

	    The design is the same as the <a href=http://www.velleman.be/kits/k8003.htm>Velleman K8003 dimmer</a>,
	  which is a fine kit that I have built several times.</p>
